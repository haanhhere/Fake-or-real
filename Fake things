Here are short and easy signs to spot fake products:
	1.	Price too cheap compared to the real one.
	2.	Packaging or label looks blurry, has spelling errors, or missing logo/barcode.
	3.	Poor material quality – easy to scratch, fade, or has a strong plastic/glue smell.
	4.	Messy details – uneven stitching or excess glue.
	5.	No authenticity seal, receipt, or warranty card.
	6.	QR code or product code doesn’t show up on the official website.
	7.	Logo looks different – wrong font, size, or position.

👉 Tip: Always compare with the real product or check on the brand’s official website before buying.
